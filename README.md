Please note that this is cca. 20 years old code, not particullary something
to write home about :-))
   
It's taylored to my own needs, modify it to suit your own. I'm not a professional programmer,
so this isn't the best code you'll find on the web, you have been warned :-))

All the bugs are guaranteed to be genuine, and are exclusively mine =)
